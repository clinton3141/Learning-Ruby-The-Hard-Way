## More extra credit

1. Using 4.0 is _not_ neccessary in this case - it just turns the result into a float, but the calculation results in a whole number, so the floating put isn't needed. Changing it to 4 instead of 4.0 will change the result to be an int instead of float, but it's value will remain the same.

2. A floating point number is a representation of a decimal number inside digital machines. They are not 100% accurate and can lead to problems in precise calculations. For more information see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems>

3-6. Trivial ;)
